# 🏡 Task 3: Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 3**.  
The objective is to implement **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression** to predict housing prices and understand regression concepts.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Implement Linear Regression using **Scikit-learn**  
- Understand evaluation metrics: **MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²**  
- Visualize regression results and interpret coefficients  

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Housing Price Prediction Dataset**.  
You can get the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction).  

For demo purposes, the Boston Housing dataset is also used (via GitHub raw link).

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Import and preprocess the dataset  
2. Split data into **train-test sets**  
3. Fit a **Linear Regression model**  
4. Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²  
5. Plot regression line & visualize actual vs predicted values  
6. Interpret the coefficients  

---

## 📊 Results
- Model Evaluation Metrics are printed in the notebook  
- Scatter plot shows **Actual vs Predicted Prices**  
- Coefficients table explains the importance of features  

---

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations
- **Correlation Heatmap**  
- **Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot**  

---

## 📝 Interview Questions Covered
1. What assumptions does linear regression make?  
2. How do you interpret the coefficients?  
3. What is R² score and its significance?  
4. When would you prefer MSE over MAE?  
5. How do you detect multicollinearity?  
6. What is the difference between simple and multiple regression?  
7. Can linear regression be used for classification?  
8. What happens if you violate regression assumptions?
